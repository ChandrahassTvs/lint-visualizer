It's time to say BYE BYE! to the old-school terminal based output for your lint errors/warnings. With the all new **Lint Visualizer**, you will now have a clear way to visualize your lint errors/warnings and keep track of them as they are being fixed. It comes with a couple of handy features that help the developers to clearly work on the errors/warnings and easily launch google search for the fix.

> *Currently supports only **Angular** based projects*

## Highlights

- Issues are grouped as Errors/Warnings 
- Resolved issues can be viewed under a separate section
- Easy to copy the results in **JSON** format
- Search for the issue in google by clicking on the issue title

## Installation

Use the package manager **npm** to install lint-visualizer.

```bash
npm install lint-visualizer
```

## Usage

```
$ lint-visualizer -p <Project Name> [options]
```

The results will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) once the command is executed successfully 


## Options

| Option | Alias | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `-configuration` | `-c` | Specify the configuration to use |
| `-tslint-config` | `-tc` | The name of the TSLint configuration file |

## Roadmap ðŸš€

Looking to improve this tool by adding more features going forward as mentioned below:
